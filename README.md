# Tip-Calculator
Created a Tip Calculator that has a slider and a seekbar for calculating the percentage based on how many people are in the party. There is also an options menu that displays the info describing the app, as well as a share button that lets you message someone on how much money they need to pay. There are also buttons to show if someone does not want the tip, if somewhere were to pay the tip or if someone where to want the total
